In this project, we successfully developed a machine learning model for detecting leaf diseases, enabling fast, real-time monitoring and scalability for detecting various diseases with larger datasets. Early detection of leaf diseases can significantly reduce crop loss, save costs on treatments, and lessen the environmental impact by minimizing chemical usage. Future work includes improving model robustness with diverse datasets, developing a user-friendly mobile application, and exploring advanced machine learning techniques.
